# Strucutal Finite ELement analysis library
This libaray presents the finite element method for strucutral mechanics problems, currently focused on making accelerated solutions to the problem

## Finite Element Procedure:
The finite element method is a complex mathamatical procedure and I am  by no means an expert at it, but this section is meant to present a general procedure for solving finite element structural mechanics problems.
